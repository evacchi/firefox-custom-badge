Custom Badge
============

A very basic (**OS X only**) Firefox extension to add a custom badge on the Dock icon. 
Useful to distinguish between different profiles, without fiddling with launchers, `plist`s and `icns`. (Perfect companion for [Profilist](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/profilist/)!)

**IMPORTANT!** A new, improved, easier to use version of this addon is now available at [jf's repository](https://github.com/jf/fosx-label). I strongly advise to look at this version. My code will stay here for historical reasons.

Usage
-----

1. Go to `about:config` 
2. add a new `string` value named `extensions.custom-badge.value` 
   and set it to the desired text (e.g., "Fun", "Work" etc.)
3. ???
4. PROFIT!
